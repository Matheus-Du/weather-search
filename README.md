# weather-search
Python program that takes weather information from the weather network on various Canadian cities and displays the information in a basic tkinter GUI frame.

Uses selenium and bs4 to query the weather network website, extracts the temperature, and then displays it on the tkinter GUI.

User can select the province and city they want to find the weather for, and the program will return an error if the city or province the user is requesting does not exist.
